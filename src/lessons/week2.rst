 1. Way back at the start of the year, we played with patterns of geometric figures constructed out of toothpicks, using them to construct linear equations.  I'd like to refresh our memory on those for a bit -- so please make the equation that matches the following pattern:

   :align: center



.. table:: Values for the triangle sequence

   =============  ==============
   x (triangles)  y (toothpicks)
   =============  ==============
          1             3
          2             5
          3             7
          4             9
          5             ??
   =============  ============== 
..


 2. Now try for the sequence of squares:

   :align: center
..


 3. What we learned before was that all sequences like this could be represented by equations like :math:`y = mx + b`, where the **b** represented something about the shared sides between new shapes and the old shapes, the **x** represented the number of shapes, and the **m** represented how many toothpicks were added at each level.
