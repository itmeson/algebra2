=====
Day 1
=====

We're going to start with a diagnostic pre-test, which is intended to find out
what parts you've already got down and which you don't.  No need to study, no
calculator allowed, but do your best -- the better you all do, the less time we
will spend on the pre-requisites, and the more time we will spend on more
interesting stuff.

If there's time when the diagnostic is done, we'll be doing a mathematical
game.  If you finish before others you can read quietly.

Day 2
=====

Another linear model, the silly taxi:

How much would it cost to take a taxi from SAAS to Mark's second favorite
bookstore, Left Bank Books at Pike Place market?

How much would it cost to take a taxi from SAAS to the best bookstore in the
world:  Powell's in Portland?

...

and a potentially useful `tool <http://maps.google.com>`_
