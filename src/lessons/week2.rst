 1. Way back at the start of the year, we played with patterns of geometric figures constructed out of toothpicks, using them to construct linear equations.  I'd like to refresh our memory on those for a bit -- so please make the equation that matches the following pattern:

   :align: center



.. table:: Values for the triangle sequence

   =============  ==============
   x (triangles)  y (toothpicks)
   =============  ==============
          1             3
          2             5
          3             7
          4             9
          5             ??
   =============  ============== 
..


 2. Now try for the sequence of squares:

   :alt: Square constructed out of toothpicks
   :align: center
..


 3. What we learned before was that all sequences like this could be represented by equations like :math:`y = mx + b`, where the **b** represented something about the shared sides between new shapes and the old shapes, the **x** represented the number of shapes, and the **m** represented how many toothpicks were added at each level. 

 4. Now I'd like to try a different kind of pattern, made up of dots to represent  the numbers, like this:

.. image:: images/square-dots.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Using dot patterns to represent the sequences instead of toothpicks
   :align: center
..

 What is the sequence of numbers that goes with this sequence of dots?  What is the equation that matches the sequence?  What kind of equation does it have to be?

Triangular numbers.

Sequence of rectangles?  x(x+1)

x(x+2)
