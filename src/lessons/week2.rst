=====
Day 1
=====

We're going to start with a diagnostic pre-test, which is intended to find out
what parts you've already got down and which you don't.  No need to study, no
calculator allowed, but do your best -- the better you all do, the less time we
will spend on the pre-requisites, and the more time we will spend on more
interesting stuff.

If there's time when the diagnostic is done, take a look at the following
images

   :scale: 15%
   :alt: A cube

   This figure is constructed entirely from straight lines, image by `Lionel Deimel. <http://info.deimel.org/cube.html>`_ See if you can make some interesting images using the same technique in your notebook.

   By drawing straight lines from one grid point to another you can make the appearance of curves.

Day 2
=====

Another linear model, the silly taxi:

How much would it cost to take a taxi from SAAS to an excellent bookstore, 
Third Place Books?

How much would it cost to take a taxi from SAAS to the best bookstore in the
world:  Powell's in Portland? (specifically, Building 2, which has all the
math and science books)

...

and a potentially useful `tool <http://maps.google.com>`_
