=====
Day 1
=====

 1. Introduce grouping.  We're going to work with assigned partners for a while, changed randomly every few days, so you can get the experience of working with many different people.  We're also going to focus on making excellent use of all class time -- this class doesn't have much homework for a reason, but that only works if we accomplish the same level of content coverage and practice that a class with homework would.  And we can only do that if we are very focused during class time.

 2. Solving linear systems by hand.  Practice on the quiz question from last week.

    a. Use desmos to help you get the equations right

    b. use whiteboard to solve the equations.

    c. check your work with desmos

 3. what to do when you think you're finished.  I want you to begin practicing managing your time in a sophisticated way -- whenever you are finished with something, try to decide by yourself what the best next step might be.  Here are some possibilities:

    a. ask for another problem

    b. Make up another related problem

    c. Check your work / share it with someone else and compare

    d. Work out other problems /use the text book or Khan

    e. Make entries in your notebook

    f. work on a math project

Day 2
=====

 1. More solving equations and systems of equations by hand


=====
Day 3
=====

 1. Water works -- another (and probably last for a while) project by Desmos, that practices further representing complicated motions using graphs.
