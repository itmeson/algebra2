Day 1
=====

A short week, conferences on Monday and Tuesday, so we only have two class meetings this week. A single block and a double block.

 1. Finish Water Line activity by constructing graphs for your classmates' vases

 2. Play with systems of linear equations by animating them with sliders in Desmos.  Construct the most interesting mathematical animation, and share with the class.

Day 2
=====

 1. Finish constructing animations, write a description of the principles you used in constructing them
