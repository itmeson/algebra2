Day 1

 1. With the new term, grades will be starting over from scratch.  Please note that links to relevant materials are now on the course Moodle page,and that the location for this website has changed slightly -- make sure to bookmark the new link from the Moodle page.  

 2. Our goal this week is to get stronger at handling complicated linear models.  In any linear model we have a relationship like :math:`y = mx + b`.  The **b** represents a *starting point*, the **m** represents a *rate*, the **x** has usually represented an amount of time, and the **y** has represented an amount of stuff (feet, cookies, money, etc.)  One of our issues has been confusing each of these items with each other (so sometimes putting a time where the starting point goes, for example), and we also need to become more comfortable with the idea that these quantities can represent many *different kinds of things*.

 For example, if the **x** represented *dollars* and the **y** represented *Euros*, the **m** would be an exchange rate between the two currencies (and the **b** might be a fixed fee that you pay to exchange the money).

 In the problem we're working on this week, we are trying to figure out how to account for different kinds of rates....

The question: How long will it take to go up the wrong way on the escalator?

Day 2
=====

 1. So in thinking about the work we did yesterday, I was struck by the fact that we're in a new classroom, one that is most often used for Mock Trial and the Speech and Debate teams.  Given that atmosphere, the solutions you were all working on yesterday for the escalator problem were really *unconvincing*.  Math isn't just about following procedures -- it is about marshalling evidence to prove a point.  So when you tell me that you think it will take 40 seconds to go up the escalator the wrong way -- you should be able to tell me **why** you think that.  What evidence supports that?  Think about that as you work today -- your goal is to convince me, and to convince the class, that you are right.  That you can predict exactly how long it will take.

 2. If it takes 30 steps for me to cross this classroom, and I take 2 steps every second, how long will it take me?

 3. If I take 30 steps to cross the room, and it takes me 20 seconds to do it, how fast am I moving my feet?

 4. If I am moving at 2 steps every second, but I am walking on a moving floor that moves at 4 steps every second -- how fast am I moving, really?

Day 3
=====

 1. The key to the elevator problem is to figure out the speed of the person walking *by himself* and the speed of the escalator steps *by themselves*.  There are several ways to do this, but the most straightforward is to time how long it takes the walker to get up the stairs and to time how long it takes him when he's using the escalator the normal way.

 2. The walker's speed is the total distance travelled divided by the time it takes to get up the stairs.  You can measure the total distance in a lot of different ways -- in stair steps, in inches (using the images of the stair treads).  

 3. The speed with the escalator is found the same way -- distance divided by time.  The tricky part of this, conceptually, is that the distance has to be the *same as the one on the stairs*.  Why?  Because the total distance he travels on the escalator has to be the same as the total distance on the stairs, because they both start and end at the same place.  So however you figured out the total distance for the stairs, *use the same number for the escalator*.  This is the point that tripped up most people in the class.

 4. How do you use those speeds to find the speed of the escalator by itself?  

 5. Once you find the speed of the escalator by itself, how do you find the effective speed of the person working against the escalator?

 6. Once you know the effective speed against the escalator, how do you find the *time* to get up the escalator the wrong way?
