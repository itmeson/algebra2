 1. With the new term, grades will be starting over from scratch.  Please note that links to relevant materials are now on the course Moodle page,and that the location for this website has changed slightly -- make sure to bookmark the new link from the Moodle page.  

 2. Our goal this week is to get stronger at handling complicated linear models.  In any linear model we have a relationship like :math:`y = mx + b`.  The **b** represents a *starting point*, the **m** represents a *rate*, the **x** has usually represented an amount of time, and the **y** has represented an amount of stuff (feet, cookies, money, etc.)  One of our issues has been confusing each of these items with each other (so sometimes putting a time where the starting point goes, for example), and we also need to become more comfortable with the idea that these quantities can represent many *different kinds of things*.

 For example, if the **x** represented *dollars* and the **y** represented *Euros*, the **m** would be an exchange rate between the two currencies (and the **b** might be a fixed fee that you pay to exchange the money).

 In the problem we're working on this week, we are trying to figure out how to account for different kinds of rates....

The question: How long will it take to go up the wrong way on the escalator?

Day 2
=====

 1. So in thinking about the work we did yesterday, I was struck by the fact that we're in a new classroom, one that is most often used for Mock Trial and the Speech and Debate teams.  Given that atmosphere, the solutions you were all working on yesterday for the escalator problem were really *unconvincing*.  Math isn't just about following procedures -- it is about marshalling evidence to prove a point.  So when you tell me that you think it will take 40 seconds to go up the escalator the wrong way -- you should be able to tell me **why** you think that.  What evidence supports that?  Think about that as you work today -- your goal is to convince me, and to convince the class, that you are right.  That you can predict exactly how long it will take.

 2. If it takes 30 steps for me to cross this classroom, and I take 2 steps every second, how long will it take me?

 3. If I take 30 steps to cross the room, and it takes me 20 seconds to do it, how fast am I moving my feet?

 4. If I am moving at 2 steps every second, but I am walking on a moving floor that moves at 4 steps every second -- how fast am I moving, really?
