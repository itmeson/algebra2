 1. What is factoring?
 
 2. Why do we care?

 3. How to do it.


=====
Day 1
=====

 1. Distributing binomials.  Write each of these in an equivalent form:

.. math::

  (x+2)(x+3) & \\
  (x+4)(x-1) & \\
  (x-5)(x-3) \\
..

 2. What patterns do you notice in the work from 1?

.. math::

  (x+2)(x+3) & \\
  x^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 & \\
  x^2 + 5x + 6 &
..

 If you write each of the distributing steps, every single time there is a part in the middle that is the sum of the two numbers in the two starting binomials, and the last number is the product of the two numbers in the binomial.  :math:`2+3 = 5` and :math:`2\cdot 3 = 6`.  Does that pattern always hold?

.. math::

 (2x+5)(x+3) & \\
 2x^2 + 6x + 5x + 15
..

 These have a more complicated form, but the last term is still the product of the last two numbers :math:`5\cdot 3 = 15`, the first term is still the product of the first terms in the binomials :math:`2x \ cdot x = 2x^2`, and the middle terms are from adding together something.

Day 2
=====

 1. Write each of these expressions in a a form that is equivalent to the original:

.. math::

  6 \cdot 84 & \\
  3(a^2 + 9) & \\
  4x(2x - 5) & \\
  -3x(5x - 3x) & \\
..

 2. Each of these is distributing.  How is the first one distribution?

.. math::

 6 \cdot 84 & \\
 6 (80 + 4) & \\
 480 + 24 & \\
 504 &
..

 3. They are all making use of the distributive property.  Mental math in general makes frequent use of the distributive property to make the substeps of a calculation simpler.

 4. Now how about writing the number 492 as a multiplication problem:


 There are a lot of ways to do it, but they all involve indentifying numbers that divide evenly into 492.  Like :math:`2 \cdot 246 = 496`, a skill we will be practicing a lot in the next few days.

Day 3
=====

 1. Write the following as multiplication problems:

.. math::

 1.&  25b^2 - 35  \\
 2.&  x^2 - 2x \\
 3.&  -27x^2 - 9x
..

 2. You have to identify numbers that divide evenly into each term in the original expression, and pay attention to the sign of each term.

 3. Now how about these:


 5. Why do we care, again?

 1. More practice, practice.
