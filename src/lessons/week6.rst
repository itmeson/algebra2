:summary: Beginning to model more complicated situations in which two "people" compete in some way, running, earning money, making cookies, and at same point they all share the same values
:category: lessons
:tags: systems, linear, desmos, pursuit 


=====
Day 1
=====

 1. **A** runs at 20 feet per second.  **B** runs at 15 feet per second, but had a headstart of 300 feet.  When will A catch up to B?

 2. Make a table of values showing the location of the two runners in Desmos

 3. Try to make equations that fit the table values for the runners.

 4. How do you account for the headstart?

=====
Day 2
=====

 1. **A** saves \\$23 per week, started one year ago.  **B** saves \\$30 per week, started today. When does B catch A?

 2. What is the same about this problem compared to the pursuit question? what is different? 


=====
Day 3
=====

 1. **A** loses \\$150 per day, starts with \\$9000 in reserves. **B** has a debt of \\$10,000, makes \\$220 per day. When do they each break even? When does B have the same as A?

 2. Transformations with DESMOS.  In the standard equation for a line, $y = mx + b$, what happens when you change the m?  What changes when you change the b?  Try it on the graph linked below.
