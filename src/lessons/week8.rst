Day 1
=====

 1. Coin counting video.  There are \\$62 worth of coins in that video, all of them quarters and pennies.  1400 coins in all.  How many of each type are there?

 2. What do you do when you don't know where to start?  Guess and check.  Make an organized table of guess and check values to help guide you to make better and better "guesses"

 3. What do you notice about these guesses?  They all have the structure of an equation: 100 quarters + 1300 pennies = 25 dollars plus 12 dollars = 37 dollars.  Too low.  So ... I must need more quarters.

 4. How can we write the equation structure of the guess using variables to save us time and space?

 5. How do we force the number of pennies and quarters to always add up to 1400?  Can we write a second equation that handles that?

 6.  Huh.  You've got two different equations now, each with two variables in them.  The equations don't look like $y = mx +b$ equations, though.  So what can we do?  Can Desmos handle equations in other forms? .... (yes, it can.  Try it.)

 7. Now that you've got a solution using Desmos, can you figure out how to solve it using the equations directly?

Day 2
=====

 1. Function Carnival.  A project built by Desmos that allows you to work on representing complicated motions using graphs, and to share your work with the rest of the class.  It's important to work slowly and carefully on this -- do work you can be proud of, so you can honestly reflect on how to improve how well your graphs represent the motions.

 2. What's the difference between a graph of Position vs. Time for, for example, the parachute problem, and a *picture* or *video* showing that motion?


=====
Day 3
=====

 1. Car Park.  Another project built by Desmos whose objective is to help you build an equation representation of a problem that you *could* solve by eye/estimation, but which gets increasingly difficult to do as complexity is added to the situation.  But the right equation can handle that complexity automatically.  

 2. Compare the method you used to solve the first question by eye, with how the equation you write solves the last question.  What did you have to do to figure out the equation?

 3. This question is another example of "What do you do when you don't know how to start?" In this case, the answer for most of you was to back up a couple of steps, and do a simpler situation again.  The first time you did the simpler situation, you were able to guess your way to the answer. But by going back to it again, you were able to understand *why* the guess worked, and use that deeper knowledge to construct an equation for the simpler situation.  And *then* you could use the equation from the simpler situation to build the one for the more complicated situation.  This is a frequent pattern in real problem-solving.  We often don't know how to do the question we start with, but you can make progress by moving *backward* first, into an easier case that you do know how to solve, and then *iterating* forward to apply that easier case in a new way.

Day 4
=====

 1. Quiz!!  Another linear pursuit problem.  Quiz4-Week7_

 2. A simple model for tracking potential Ebola cases entering the United States.  How difficult would it be to keep track of the 150 people who enter the US from affected countries daily, if you need to keep tabs on them for 21 days each?
