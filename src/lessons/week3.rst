 1. Will it go in?  Is the basketball shot in the following image going to go in the basket?

 The image can be imported into Desmos, and you can try to find an equation that goes through the basketballs and through the hoop -- since the ball in flight obeys some equation, that might be evidence that the ball will go in.  Try it out at `this graph <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/d9wsd2dg9t>`_.

 Since the path of the ball is obviously not a straight line, a linear equation isn't going to work.  So our next guess should be a quadratic, something like :math:`y = ax^2 + bx + c`.  Try to modify these parameters in the graph to match the path of the basketball.

A Christmas puzzle:

Disclaimer: I am not taking a position on the reality of Santa Claus.

According to the standard American version of the Santa Claus story, Santa visits every house (in the world?) that has (good?) children in it, parking his sleigh pulled by reindeer on the roof while he pops down the chimney to deliver a present for each child and to eat some cookies and drink some milk (how much?) and collect some refueling carrots for the reindeer (how many?).  He then pops back up the chimney, gets in the sleigh, calls out a merry message, and moves on to the next house.  

Through careful route planning, Santa actually has about 31 hours available to him to work (24time zones, travelling westward, he can stay in darkness for about 31 hours straight).

The story raises a number of important questions, the answers to which depend on some assumptions you would have to make, since we don’t really know how Santa works and we don’t have access to his lists or his logistics management team.  Choose one or more questions to work out, show all your work on whiteboards, making clear any assumptions you make.  (Any time you need an actual number, just estimate what that number is, and write it down)

How much time can he spend at each house?

How fast does he need to be moving between houses?

How many cookies does he get?

Is the supply of carrots enough to keep the reindeer peppy all night?

How big must the gift bag be, on the inside?

How heavy is the sleigh?
