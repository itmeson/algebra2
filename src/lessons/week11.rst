Day 2

We've been struggling as a class to understand how to represent headstarts in our linear models.  A "headstart" in the problems we have been doing has been a situation where one person gets to work sooner than someone else, but the person that starts later tends to work faster, and so catches up at some point.  when we make equations to represent the work done by the two, that early start needs to be translated into the equation form.

"Translate" is an important word here, because it gives a clue as to one way to think about what the equation is doing to reflect the headstart.  Consider the  two equations $y = 2x$ and $y = 2x + 10$.  The two equations have the same slope, but different "starting points".  If you draw the graphs for the two equations, the second one looks just like the first, but shifted upward by 10.  That shift is also called a *translation* -- the line is *translated* by 10 units upward.  

The Desmos graph linked here displays several other kinds of translations and transformations of an equation.  Play with the simulation and the sliders.  Attempt to understand what the b and d values do to the lines and their pictures.  Write down:

 1. What changes when you change the b value?  Why does it change those positions, and not the others?

 2. What changes when you change the d value?  Why does it change those positions, and not any others?

 3. What changes when the m value changes?  Why?

Day 3

So yesterday's exploration was a little confusing, and I think it stems in part to needing to remind ourselves what an equation really is.  So I'm going to ask some silly questions and try to get to a better understanding of equations.  For each of the following, write down whether the statement is True or False.

 1. The sky is blue.

 2. $ 2 = 2 $

 3. $ 4 = 7 $ 

 4. $ x + 7 = 10 $

 5. $ x + 7 = x$

 6. $ 2x = 2x$

Pause:  what is an equation?

It's a sentence that is either true or false.  An interesting question about an equation, just as with a sentence, is whether it is true or false -- and what conditions make it true or make it false.  "The sky is blue" is probably a true statement,depending on how you define "sky", "blue",and "is" -- since arguably it doesn't have any color itself, it just scatters more blue light to your eyes than other colors, so it looks blue.  

But $ 2 = 2 $ isn't ambiguous.  It's true.  No matter what.  $4 = 7$ is false, even in the Matrix.  $x + 7 = 10$ is true only in one condition -- on the condition that the $x$ is equal to $3$.  

$x+7 = x$ cannot be true, no matter what the x stands for.  And $2x=2x$ is always true, no matter what.

An equation is a sentence that is is either true or false.  An interesting question about an equations is what conditions make it true, and what conditions make it false.

 7. $y = 3x - 5$

What conditions make that one true?  Does the x value by itself make it true?

Does the y value by itself make it true?

No?  

The equation is only true for specific pairs of numbers.  One such pair is $(0, -5)$, since having $x=0$ and $y=-5$ works.  Another is $(1,-2)$.  There's actually an infinite number of **pairs** of numbers that fit in the equation.  

But also an infinite number of pairs that **don't** fit.  The pairs that do fit are *on the line*.  The pairs that don't are not on the line.  

So what is an equation of a line?

 1. It's a sentence that is either true or false. And we want to know what conditions make it true or false.

 2. It's a list of pairs of points, the pairs that make the equation true.

 3. It's a line, a picture, a graph, whose slope is the number next to the x  in the slope-intercept form (how fast the line moves), and whose y-intercept is the number by itself in the slope-intercept form.  

The most basic linear equation is $y = x$.  The pairs of points that fit on that line are the ones where the x and y value are the same   $(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (-5,-5) \\ldots$.

All the other lines are *transformations* of that basic line.  Transformations that change the conditions which make the equation true; which alters the picture/line/graph to be steeper or less steep, or to start from a different place; which shift the pairs of points that make the equation true.

When we're trying to understand what the $d$ in $y = 3(x+d)$ does, we have several methods at our disposal.  We can ask what happens to the conditions that made the equation true.  We can ask what happens to the picture of the graph.  And we can ask what happens to the pairs of points that made the equation true. 

So explore desmos the following transformations, looking at the conditions that make the equations true, the pciture of the graph, and the pairs of points that fit -- both before and after the transformation is made.

 1. $y = x$

 2. $y = mx$  (what does the m do?)

 3. $y = x + b$ (what doe sthe b do?)

 4. $y = mx + b$ (what do m and b do together?)

 5. $(y-b) = mx$  (what does the b do?)

 6. $y = m(x+d)$ (what does the d do?)

 7. $(y-b) = m(x+d)$ (what does the combination of m, b, and d do?)
