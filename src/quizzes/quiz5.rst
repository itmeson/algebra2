1.  $y = 3x + 10$     ,    $y = -6x -17$

These two equations produce lines that intersect somewhere.  What are the x and y values where the lines intersect.  Use pencil and paper only.



2. $2x + 4y = 10$    ,    $y = 5x - 10$

These two equations produce lines that intersect somewhere.  What are the x and y values where the lines intersect.  Use pencil and paper only.
