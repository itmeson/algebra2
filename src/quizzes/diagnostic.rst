:summary: A diagnostic quiz will be given in class on Monday.  No studying necessary, this is just a check to see where everyone is at.

We're going to start with a diagnostic pre-test, which is intended to find out what parts you've already got down and which you don't. No need to study, no calculator allowed, but do your best -- the better you all do, the less time we will spend on the pre-requisites, and the more time we will spend on more interesting stuff.
