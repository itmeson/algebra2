:summary: Quiz 3 on systems of linear equations


1.  Solve for x:  :math:`17x - 17 = 34`



2.  This question has many parts.  Each part is a different skill, so try to do as
many of them as possible, but you will still get credit for each one you do get
even if you don’t finish all of it.

**A:  Runs at 20 feet per second.**

**B:  Runs at 14 feet per second, but had a 3 minute head start.**


 1. How much time will pass before A catches up to B?  

 2. How far will A and B each have travelled?

 3. How much time will it take for A and B each to reach 10,000 feet travelled?


* Make tables in Desmos showing the positions of the two runners at various times

* Make equations in Demos that give the correct positions of the two runners

* Use Desmos to answer the two questions

* Save the Desmos document that shows all this work, then use the “Share” function to send me a link to your graph

* Write the equations on paper, and use the equations directly to solve the three questions
