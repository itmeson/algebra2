:summary: Quiz 4, Week 7, covering a linear pursuit problem that must be solved analytically and using Desmos to graph the system of equations



A:  Makes 155 cookies per hour, started work at 10am

B:  Makes 70 cookies per hour, started work at 7:30 am

C:  Makes 90 cookies per hour, started work at 7:30 am


For 1-6, show all work in Desmos.  Put text labels in boxes above or below each part to explain what you are doing.  Save the graph with the title: YourFirstName_YourLastName_QuizWeek8.  Share it with Mark when you are done


 1. Make tables in Desmos for all three people, showing how many cookies they each have made after 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, etc. of work.  Ignore the headstarts

 2. Make equations for all three people, which match the points given by the tables in 1.  Still ignore the headstarts

 3. Now make equations for all three that account for the headstarts (if any)

 4. When does A catch up to B? (mark the point in desmos and write it here)

 5. When does A catch up to C? (mark the point in desmos and write it here)

 6. When does A catch up to the combined total of B & C?  (mark the point in desmos and write it here)

 7. Solve question 4 again, using pencil and paper and the equations you made in number 3.

 8. Solve question 6 again, using pencil and paper and the equations you made in number 3.
