Grades in this class will be assigned based on a weighted average of your
performance in these categories:

* 10%	Homework 
* 20%	Algebra Notebook
* 20%   Class work and participation
* 50%	Course Skills


Homework is about practice, not about learning new skills, so it will largely be things you have done before, and there will generally not be very much of it in terms of the time it should take you.  If you think that you need more practice at something **let me know**!

The notebook is going to be like a textbook that you will write for yourself, recording the things we've done this year and the things you learn.  It will be checked every few weeks for completeness, and you will almost always be allowed to use it during quizzes and tests.

Class work and participation is just that -- how well you do at producing during class time.  I don't assign very much homework, but I expect a lot of work during class.  You will get regular feedback if I think you are not doing your share during class. 

The Course Skills are the skills and concepts that you are expected to know /
be able to do when you complete this class.  They are assessed primarily
through quizzes that will take place weekly, but also through your in-class
work, presentations, and in discussion with me.  Essentially, this category is
about proving to me and to yourself that you are able to do it, and I will bend
over backwards to find ways that allow you to prove this.

By default, you will be assessed on skills every Friday on a quiz.  A few new
skills will show up on each quiz, along with a few old skills.  You will
receive a score on each skill on a 0-4 scale:

 * 0 for no effort
 * 1 for a minor attempt
 * 2 for incomplete work or several major mistakes
 * 3 for being close, but with small mistakes
 * 4 for perfection

Retries on a particular skill will usually be somewhat *more difficult* than
the first try. If your score decreases, you should note the regression so you
can practice more, but your gradebook score will not change.  If your score
improves, you will keep the new score.  Your goal is to assess at a 4 level on
every skill *twice*.  Once you get the second 4, your gradebook score for the 
skill will be recorded as a 5, and you will not be required to take the same
skill again.  If you get a single 4, this will be an 80% for the skill, if you get 
two 3's, I will count it as a 3.5, or 70% for the skill.  **Earning an A requires
demonstrating mastery twice, a B requires demonstrating mastery once**

You can request a re-try on any skill you want to improve your score on 
by requesting an appointment during break, at lunch, or before or after school.
You should use the "Make Appointment" link above to arrange a time -- I need at
least one day warning before a re-try so I can prepare new questions for you,
or if you are requesting that I evaluate your mastery in a different way than
a written quiz.

You should keep track of your scores on skill assessments in your algebra
notebook, and you will also receive an email about once per week with an updated
report on your performance on each skill and your overall grades.
