Grades in this class will be assigned based on a weighted average of your
performance in these categories:

* 10%	Homework_ 
* 30%	Algebra Notebook
* 60%	Course Skills_ -- See below


The Course Skills are the skills and concepts that you are expected to know /
be able to do when you complete this class.  They are assessed primarily
through quizzes that will take place weekly, but also through your in-class
work, presentations, and in discussion with me.  Essentially, this category is
about proving to me and to yourself that you are able to do it, and I will bend
over backwards to find ways that allow you to prove this.

By default, you will be assessed on skills every Friday on a quiz.  A few new
skills will show up on each quiz, along with a few old skills.  You will
receive a score on each skill on a 0-4 scale:

 * 0 for no effort
 * 1 for a minor attempt
 * 2 for incomplete work or several major mistakes
 * 3 for being close, but with small mistakes
 * 4 for perfection

Retries on a particular skill will usually be somewhat *more difficult* than
the first try. If your score decreases, you should note the regression so you
can practice more, but your gradebook score will not change.  If your score
improves, you will keep the new score.  Your goal is to assess at a 4 level on
every skill *twice*.  Once you get the second 4, your gradebook score for the 
skill will be recorded as a 5, and you will not be required to take the same
skill again.  If you get a single 4, this will be an 80% for the skill, if you get 
two 3's, I will count it as a 3.5, or 70% for the skill.  **Earning an A requires
demonstrating mastery twice, a B requires demonstrating mastery once**

You can request a re-try on any skill you want to improve your score on 
by requesting an appointment during break, at lunch, or before or after school.
You should use the "Make Appointment" link above to arrange a time -- I need at
least one day warning before a re-try so I can prepare new questions for you,
or if you are requesting that I evaluate your mastery in a different way than
a written quiz.

You should keep track of your scores on skill assessments in your algebra
notebook, and you will also receive an email about once per week with an updated
report on your performance on each skill and your overall grades.
